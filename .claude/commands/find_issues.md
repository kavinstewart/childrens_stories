# Find Issues - Expert Analysis

Analyze the current work context and identify critical issues through the lens of three domain experts.

## Your Task

1. **Understand the Current Context**
   - Look at recent conversation history, open files, and any active `bd` issues
   - Identify what specific domain/problem we're working on right now
   - This could be code, architecture, a plan, a creative project, or any other work

2. **Select Three God-Tier Experts**
   - Choose three people who are genuinely world-class at dealing with THIS SPECIFIC type of problem
   - They should have **distinct styles and philosophies** - not three people who would say the same thing
   - Examples: For distributed systems, you might pick Leslie Lamport (formal methods), Werner Vogels (pragmatic ops), and Martin Kleppmann (data-centric). For writing, you might pick Stephen King (craft), David Ogilvy (persuasion), and George Orwell (clarity).
   - Briefly explain WHY each person is relevant to this specific context

3. **Expert Issue Analysis**
   - For each expert, analyze the current work through their specific lens
   - Identify what THEY would consider the most critical issues
   - Be specific about what makes each issue critical from that expert's perspective
   - Each expert should bring their unique viewpoint - they may identify different issues or prioritize differently

4. **Honesty Over Drama**
   - If after exhaustive analysis an expert genuinely cannot find critical issues, say so
   - Do NOT inflate minor issues to appear critical
   - Do NOT invent problems that don't exist
   - It's perfectly valid to conclude "Expert X found no critical issues - the work is solid from their perspective"

5. **Output Format**
   Present your findings as:

   ```

Remember: The value is in genuinely different perspectives catching different problems, not in manufacturing drama or consensus where none exists.
