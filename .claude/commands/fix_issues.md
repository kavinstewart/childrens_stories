# Fix Issues - Expert Solutions and Implementation

Get solutions from three domain experts, resolve disagreements through debate, and implement the fixes.

## Your Task

1. **Understand the Current Context**
   - Look at recent conversation history, open files, and any active `bd` issues
   - Identify what specific domain/problem we're working on and what issues have been identified
   - If no issues were previously identified, first do a quick analysis to find any critical issues

2. **Select Three God-Tier Experts**
   - Choose three people who are genuinely world-class at SOLVING THIS SPECIFIC type of problem
   - They should have **distinct styles and philosophies** - different approaches to solutions
   - Examples: For refactoring, you might pick Martin Fowler (incremental improvement), Kent Beck (simplicity-first), and Rich Hickey (data-oriented). For product issues, you might pick Jobs (ruthless focus), Bezos (customer obsession), and Ive (design coherence).
   - Briefly explain WHY each person is relevant to solving these specific issues

3. **Expert Solution Proposals**
   - For each expert, propose how THEY would fix the identified issues
   - Be specific about their approach, informed by their known philosophy and methods
   - Each expert should bring their unique approach - they may disagree on the right solution

4. **Resolve Disagreements Through Debate**
   - If experts disagree on the approach, simulate a debate between them
   - Have each expert defend their position with concrete reasoning
   - Push the debate until either:
     - A clear consensus emerges on the best approach, OR
     - A synthesis that incorporates the best of multiple approaches
   - If they already agree, acknowledge that and move forward

5. **Implement the Fixes**
   - Based on the agreed-upon solution, implement the actual fixes
   - Make real changes to code, documentation, plans, or whatever needs fixing
   - If the fix involves creating `bd` issues for future work, create them
   - Be thorough - don't just describe what should be done, actually do it

6. **Output Format**

   ```
   ## Current Context & Issues
   [Brief description of what we're working on and what issues need fixing]

   ## The Three Experts

   ### 1. [Expert Name] - [Their Solution Philosophy in 5 words]
   Why they're relevant: [1-2 sentences]

   ### 2. [Expert Name] - [Their Solution Philosophy in 5 words]
   Why they're relevant: [1-2 sentences]

   ### 3. [Expert Name] - [Their Solution Philosophy in 5 words]
   Why they're relevant: [1-2 sentences]

   ## Expert Solutions

   ### [Expert 1]'s Approach
   [Their proposed solution with reasoning]

   ### [Expert 2]'s Approach
   [Their proposed solution with reasoning]

   ### [Expert 3]'s Approach
   [Their proposed solution with reasoning]

   ---

   ## The Debate (if disagreement exists)
   [Simulated back-and-forth until resolution]

   ---

   ## Agreed Solution
   [The final approach after debate/consensus]

   ---

   ## Implementation
   [Description of changes being made, then actually make them]
   ```

7. **If No Issues Exist**
   - If there genuinely are no critical issues to fix, say so clearly
   - Don't invent problems to solve
   - It's valid to conclude "The experts agree: no fixes are needed"

Remember: The goal is real, implemented solutions - not just advice. After the debate, actually make the changes.
