Pepper's friends dove into the water. Splash! Splash! They popped up laughing, practicing for the big jellyfish swim.

From the ice shelf, Pepper watched every dive. Her flippers squeezed tight against her sides.

"I bet jellyfish aren't even that pretty," she muttered.

*[Illustration: Pepper (foreground right, medium-large) standing alone on pale blue ice shelf, flippers pressed tight to her body, head turned slightly away but eyes glancing toward the water. Expression conflicted—trying to look bored but eyes betraying interest. In the background (left, smaller), three young penguins splash and play in blue-green water, clearly having fun. Antarctic setting with endless daylight, ice glowing pale blue. Focus on Pepper's tense posture and the distance between her and her friends.]*

Milo waddled over, water dripping from his belly. Seaweed dangled from his shoulder.

"You coming this year?" he asked.

Pepper tucked her flippers tight against her body. "Maybe jellyfish are overrated."

Milo's smile wobbled but he didn't push.

*[Illustration: Milo (left) standing wet and dripping on the ice, seaweed draped over one shoulder, looking hopefully at Pepper. Pepper (right) mid-shrug with her head turned away, looking down at her feet, flippers still pressed to her sides. Ice shelf setting with blue-green water visible behind Milo. Focus on Pepper's averted gaze and closed-off posture contrasting with Milo's open, eager expression.]*

That night, Pepper sat alone at the edge.

The water looked black. No bottom. No end.

Her flippers hung loose at her sides now. No one to pretend for.

She had never learned to dive.

She was scared.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center, small against vast landscape) sitting alone at the ice edge, looking down at dark water. Her flippers hang limp at her sides, posture slumped and vulnerable. Expression is open and sad - no pretending. Night sky with pale light, endless ice behind her. Dark blue-black water below, suggesting depth. Focus on Pepper's smallness against the big, dark water.]*

Pepper woke before the others.

The sky was pale gray. Everyone still slept in warm huddles.

She rose onto her tiptoes. Then made herself put her feet flat.

Today she would practice. Alone. Before anyone could see her fail.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center, medium size) standing on the ice shelf in early morning gray light, deliberately pressing her feet flat against the ice with visible effort. Her expression shows nervous determination - beak set firm but eyes wide. Background shows sleeping penguin huddles (soft, blurry shapes) and the water's edge visible in the distance. The sky is pale gray-pink with low light. Focus on Pepper's feet pressing flat and her determined face.]*

Pepper ran toward the water. Fast. Faster.

Her feet locked.

She skidded across the ice and tumbled face-first into a snow pile.

Pepper lay there. Her beak burned cold. She didn't get up right away.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center) face-planted in a fluffy snow pile near the ice edge, her back flippers sticking up awkwardly, body slumped in defeat. Snow dusted across her head and back. The dark water visible just a few feet away at the edge. Early morning pale gray-blue light across the empty ice shelf. Focus on the comedic yet sympathetic image of Pepper's failed landing, flippers splayed out.]*

She found a low rock. Slid in slowly this time.

The water reached her belly. Her chest. Cold crept up.

Then her feet lifted off the bottom.

Pepper's flippers slapped the water. She kicked and splashed and scrambled back onto the rock.

She sat there, dripping. Breathing hard.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center, large) scrambling frantically out of turquoise water onto a low gray rock, flippers splayed wide and splashing, eyes wide with panic, beak open gasping. Water droplets spraying around her. Ice shelf and calm water in background contrasting with her chaotic movement. Focus on her desperate grip on the rock's edge and the wild splash of water around her body.]*

The sun hung low but never set.

Pepper sat at the edge. Her flippers drooped at her sides. The water below looked black.

She whispered it so quiet, only the ice could hear.

"What if I go down and can't come back up?"

*[Illustration: Pepper (center, medium size) sitting alone at the very edge of the ice shelf, flippers hanging loose and limp at her sides, body small and hunched. Expression vulnerable and worried, looking down at the dark water below. Low golden sun on the horizon casting long shadows. The water beneath her transitions from pale turquoise near the surface to deep ink-black depths. Empty ice around her emphasizes her isolation. Focus on Pepper's small figure against the vast, dark water.]*

Feathers brushed her side.

Gran-Gran settled onto the ice, slow and creaky. Her notched beak caught the light.

She didn't ask what was wrong.

She just looked at the water too.

"I remember that feeling," she said.

That was all.

*[Illustration: Gran-Gran (right) and Pepper (left) sitting side by side at the edge of the ice shelf, both looking out at the dark water. Gran-Gran is larger, elderly, with a distinctive notched beak, her posture relaxed and settled. Pepper is smaller, flippers drooping, looking slightly less alone than before. Low Antarctic sun casting long blue shadows on the ice. The deep water stretches before them, dark blue-black. Focus on the two penguins sitting together, close but not touching.]*

**Page 9**

Gran-Gran waddled to the edge and slid in.

Pepper gasped. But Gran-Gran didn't sink.

She bobbed right back up, easy as a bubble. Her eyes closed like she was napping.

"Penguin bellies float," she said. "Always have."

Pepper leaned forward. Her flippers loosened, just a little.

*[Illustration: Gran-Gran (center, in the water) floating peacefully on her back with eyes half-closed, her notched beak visible, bobbing at the surface like a cork. Pepper (left, on the ice edge) leaning forward with head tilted, flippers slightly away from her body instead of pressed tight, expression shifting from worried to curious. Ice shelf edge in foreground, turquoise-to-dark water around Gran-Gran. Focus on Gran-Gran's relaxed floating posture and Pepper's curious lean.]*

Pepper took a breath. She tipped forward into the shallows.

Cold wrapped around her. She kicked once, twice—down into the blue.

Then the water pushed back.

Up, up, up.

Her head broke the surface. Her eyes went wide.

She hadn't sunk. Her flippers loosened from her sides, just a little.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center, large) bursting up through shallow turquoise water, eyes wide with surprise, beak slightly open. Water droplets spraying around her head. Her flippers are out to the sides, not tucked tight for once. Gran-Gran (right, smaller) watches from the water nearby, looking pleased with half-closed eyes. Ice shelf visible in background. Focus on Pepper's surprised, hopeful expression and the splash of water around her.]*

The next morning, all the penguins crowded at the deep edge. The water below looked like ink.

Pepper waddled over. Her flippers trembled against her sides.

But she didn't stop. She stood right at the edge with everyone else.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center-right, medium size) standing at the edge of the ice shelf, flippers pressed tight and visibly trembling, beak pointed down at the dark water. Her posture shows fear but her feet are planted firmly at the very edge. Several penguin friends (left side, background) gathered and ready to dive, looking excited. Milo nearby with seaweed in his feathers, glancing at Pepper with hopeful expression. Deep blue-black water below contrasting with pale blue ice. Dawn light casting long shadows. Focus on Pepper's determined stance despite her trembling body.]*

**Page 12**

Pepper dove.

Cold rushed past her belly, her face, her flippers. Bubbles swirled everywhere.

She kicked wrong. Then kicked again.

Down she went. Then up.

Her head burst through the surface. She was breathing hard, splashing like crazy.

But she was out there. In the deep.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center, underwater) mid-dive with bubbles streaming around her, flippers spread awkwardly, legs kicking at odd angles. Expression shows wide-eyed surprise mixed with determination. Deep blue-green water surrounds her, lighter turquoise above where the surface glimmers. Other penguin silhouettes visible at the surface above. Focus on Pepper's ungraceful but triumphant movement through the water, bubbles trailing from her beak.]*

A head popped up beside her. Milo, with seaweed flopped over one eye.

"You came," he said.

Pepper paddled closer until their flippers almost touched.

Together, they swam toward the glittering reef.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center-left) and Milo (center-right) swimming side by side in open blue-green water, their flippers nearly touching. Milo has seaweed draped over one eye, grinning warmly. Pepper's expression shows relief and quiet joy, eyes bright. Other penguin friends visible swimming ahead in the background. The Shimmering Reef glitters in the distance. Focus on the closeness between Pepper and Milo, their bodies angled toward each other as they swim.]*

The jellyfish rose from below.

Gold and pink, soft as lanterns, drifting up through the dark water.

Pepper floated very still. Her flippers hung loose at her sides for the first time all week.

The light touched her feathers.

She was here. She was finally here.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center, medium close-up) floating underwater at the Shimmering Reef, surrounded by glowing jellyfish in soft gold and pink. Her flippers hang relaxed at her sides, her eyes wide with wonder, beak slightly open in awe. Milo visible nearby (smaller, to the right), also watching the jellyfish. Dark blue-green water fades to deeper black below, but the jellyfish cast warm light upward onto the penguins' faces. Focus on Pepper's wonder-struck expression and the ethereal glow of the jellyfish around her.]*

**Page 15**

They swam home as the jellyfish faded behind them.

Pepper's kicks were still wobbly. Her dives still splashed too much.

But when Milo glanced back at her, she didn't look away.

She swam a little faster to catch up.

*[Illustration: Pepper (center-right) swimming through blue-green water toward Milo and other penguin friends (left, slightly ahead). Pepper's expression is calm and content, flippers relaxed at her sides as she kicks. Milo looks back over his shoulder with a warm smile, seaweed still tangled in his feathers. Background shows the glowing reef fading in the distance behind them, water shifting from dark depths below to lighter surface above. Focus on Pepper's peaceful face and the small gap between her and her friends that she's closing.]*
